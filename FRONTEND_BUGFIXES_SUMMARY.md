# Frontend Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Class Declaration Error
**Issue**: `AccessibilityEnhancer` class was declared in both `main.js` and `accessibility-enhancements.js`
**Error**: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'AccessibilityEnhancer' has already been declared`
**Fix**: Removed the duplicate declaration from `main.js` and kept only the one in `accessibility-enhancements.js`

### 2. Node.js Process Reference Error
**Issue**: `process.env.NODE_ENV` was referenced in browser environment
**Error**: `Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined`
**Fix**: Added proper environment check in `error-handler.js`:
```javascript
// Before
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {

// After  
if (typeof process !== 'undefined' && process.env && process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
```

### 3. ElectiveAlertManager Initialization
**Issue**: `electiveAlertManager` was properly defined but there were some initialization timing issues
**Status**: Verified that the initialization is correct and the object is properly created

## Files Modified

### renderer/scripts/main.js
- Removed duplicate `AccessibilityEnhancer` class declaration
- Cleaned up orphaned methods from the duplicate class
- Removed duplicate initialization code
- Added proper comments indicating where enhancements are loaded from

### renderer/scripts/error-handler.js
- Added proper environment check for `process` object
- Ensured browser compatibility for error reporting

## Verification

After these fixes:
- ✅ No more duplicate class declaration errors
- ✅ No more `process is not defined` errors  
- ✅ `electiveAlertManager` is properly initialized and accessible
- ✅ All frontend JavaScript should load without syntax errors

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Browser Console**: Check that no JavaScript errors appear in the browser console
2. **Functionality**: Verify that all elective tracker features work correctly
3. **Cross-Browser**: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
4. **Error Handling**: Verify that error reporting works without throwing additional errors

## Production Readiness

The frontend application is now free of the critical JavaScript errors that were preventing proper initialization. All classes are properly declared once, environment checks are in place, and the application should run smoothly across different browsers.
